    "text": "Social Identity Theory (SIT) helps explain how the under-representation of women in STEM is influenced by their perceived membership in social groups just like the group: Women in STEM; and this will significantly influence their behaviors (Hogg 2016). According to SIT, when women perceive STEM as a male-dominated domain, they are less likely to pursue or persist in these fields. This is compounded by social identity threats that reduce self-esteem and motivation (Tajfel 1986).\n\n\n\nKim, Sinatra, and Seyranian (2018) found that societal beliefs about women’s roles in STEM reduce their interest and self-identification with STEM fields.\nCheryan and Plaut (2010) demonstrated that women feel less similar to the typical academic prototype in fields like computer science, reducing their interest in pursuing these disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight diverse role models: emphase that STEM is for everyone can significantly improve women’s engagement with these fields."

Women in these fields encounter unconscious bias, gendered stereotypes, and the threat of social exclusion. As a result, women are nearly 20% more likely to leave STEM careers than their male counterparts, as demonstrated in Table 2. These challenges are even more pronounced in high-demand fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), programming, and cybersecurity, where women continue to face substantial barriers (Pal, Piaget, and Zahidi 2024).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: This pie chart compares the relative proportions of women and men leaving STEM, highlighting the significant gender gap: women being 20% more likely to leave compared to men.
